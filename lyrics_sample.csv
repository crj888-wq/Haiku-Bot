Test Song 1,Sample Artist,"An old silent pond
A frog jumps into the pond
Splash, silence again

[Chorus]
la la la

Winter seclusion
Listening, that evening, to the rain
In the mountain hut"
Test Song 2,Another Artist,"Over the wintry
forest, winds howl in rage
with no leaves to blow

A new morning sun
sends gentle light through the trees
birds stir and take flight"
